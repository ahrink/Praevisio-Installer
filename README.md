# Praevisio-Installer
simulation process of file distribution to better organize scripting 

execute the script with: sh composition.sh && sleep 0.1 && sh praevisio.sh "DDC"

Depending on the internet connection speed ... please wait for pakages to install;

[Ubuntu Server 22.04] Search the praevisio.sh file for check_version() function to lower the limit set; (case Ubuntu 20). Should work but did not have the time to modify the code.
 
Why empty files? – simulation process first but, as the time permits will implement some complex versions to example: Main-loop [routine] as an “old” fashioned priority and “new” as Subroutines of (a) routine/s.

However, [emancipated version is not a default] the focus is on ahr_stamp and more advanced examples are a prerogative of old. ... That means this default will be a hello world? -yes.
